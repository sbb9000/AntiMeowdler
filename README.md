AntiMeowdler
============

Excel add-in that prevents idling.  With cats.

When loaded, this add-in inserts an icon to the "Add-ins" tab in Excel to launch a tool known as the "Anti-Meowdler."  The Anti-Meowdler keeps the user from going idle by pouncing on the keyboard every so often.

This utility is particularly useful in cases where group policy has locked-down settings related to idleness, including:
	-Automatic Lync status changes
	-Screen savers & account locking

To use:
	1. Click the icon in the add-ins tab to open the Anti-Meowdler.
	2. Indicate a meowdle (i.e. idle) time threshold (if you enter 5, a keyboard stroke will occur every 5 minutes).
	3. If you would like the Anti-Meowdler to cat-nap after a number of hours, select that option and indicate the desired number of hours.
	4. Press "Meow" to engage.
	5. To hide the window, click "Meownimize" (closing will disengage the Anti-Meowdler).
